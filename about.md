<!-- <p>“Curiosity kills a cat, not a Research Scholar”

I am Kartikay, I like diving into understanding brain mechanisms and translating them into neuroscience-inspired, efficient ML algorithms. After all, what’s an algorithm without math standing over it with a stick, demanding it confess its crimes? When I’m not wrangling data or debugging code, you’ll probably find me in an amphitheatre or a stage (probably with my guitar). Basically, I try to balance logic with a little bit of drama.</p>

# About

I am a Research Scholar at the SustainAI Lab, IIT Guwahati, working under Dr. Ayon Borthakur. My research focuses on time-series modeling for long sequences, with an emphasis on efficient sequence architectures that capture long-range temporal dependencies. 

I work with state-space models, linear attention mechanisms, and spiking neural networks to build stable and scalable representations of data. My work spans long-horizon sequence tasks and real-world time-series applications. I am also interested in continual learning, particularly parameter-efficient techniques that enable adaptive and scalable modeling.

“Curiosity kills a cat, not a Research Scholar.”

I’m Kartikay — endlessly curious about how the brain processes information and how those mechanisms can inspire efficient machine learning systems. I enjoy translating neuroscience-inspired ideas into mathematically grounded algorithms. After all, what’s an algorithm without math standing over it with a stick, demanding it justify itself?

When I’m not wrangling models or debugging code, you’ll probably find me on a stage — in theatre, in an amphitheatre, or with a guitar in hand. I try to balance logic with a little bit of drama.
